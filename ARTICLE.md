[Can AI really code? Study maps the roadblocks to autonomous software engineering](https://news.mit.edu/2025/can-ai-really-code-study-maps-roadblocks-to-autonomous-software-engineering-0716)

I find the article to raise relevant concerns that demand discussion in today’s world. With the rapidly advancing capabilities of AI, there is a growing question of whether the role and skills of software developers will continue to hold the same significance. As the article argues, there is a need to distinguish between the capabilities of AI and humans and to devise a workflow that preserves human skills by letting AI handle automated tasks while developers focus more on design, reasoning, and analysis.

An important point the article makes is that the mere generation of code cannot be classified as software engineering. The underlying work of planning, designing, and ensuring security requires analytical skills that AI has not yet mastered. This discussion encourages us to reflect on whether we have overestimated the accuracy and efficiency of AI, especially since it is still prone to errors and hallucinations and ultimately requires human judgment to identify and correct its shortcomings.
